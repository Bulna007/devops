How to compare the contents of 2 different files?
The are 2 bash commands for comparing the contents of the files
1. cmp
2. diff

1. cmp
cmp stands for compare, it is used for comparing 2 files byte by byte and output the first different between the file contents

fruits.txt
apple
banana
papaya
grapes

fresh-fruits.txt
apple
banana
papaya
oranges
grapes

when we use cmp for comparing these 2 files it compares fruits.txt and fresh-fruits.txt byte by byte and shows the first difference between those 2 files
fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt differ: 18 byte, line 5
	
if there is no difference between those 2 files, then it will not show any output.
	
1. cmp fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt
fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt differ: 18 byte, line 5
	
	
2. -b option
if we use -b option, it shows at what byte the difference has been found in the file

cmp -b fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt
fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt differ: 18 byte, line 5 g asciicode o asciicode

3. -i option
ignore the specified number of bytes starting from top in both the files while comparing
cmp -i 18 fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt
fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt differ: 3 byte, line 1

4. -i n1:n2
ignore starting from the top of the file n1 bytes in first file and n2 bytes in second file and compare
n1 = ignore n1 bytes in first file
n2 = ignore n2 bytes in second file
and begin comparing the files

cmp -i 18:20 fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt


5. -l = list all the difference between both the files
cmp -l fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt
byteposition line fruits.txt fresh-fruits.txt

2. diff
diff stands for difference, it is used for comparing the contents line by line within the given 2 files. Not only the diff command helps in comparing the contents it displays recommendations through special symbols indicating how to make the contents of the 2 files identical.
	
symbols:
1. a = add
2. c = change
3. d = delete
4. > = refers to the contents of the file2
5. < = refers to the contents of the file1

#1. add recommendation

groceries_mustbuy
----------------------

after the 3rd line in groceries add the 4th line of groceries_mustbuy and the 4th line is
> rice

#2. delete recommendation

fruits
