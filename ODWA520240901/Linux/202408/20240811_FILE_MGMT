Linux FileSystem directory structure
/ (root)
1. /bin   = linux core commands resides under this directory like mkdir, ls, cat, touch etc
2. /boot  = boot loader files are placed inside this directory
3. /dev   = all the physical devices like harddisks, pendrives, disk drives are mounted under this location
4. /etc   = configuration files of installed software packages are placed under this directory
5. /home  = per each linux user being created, there is a sub-directory for the user will be created under /home, that acts as an home directory for that user. 
6. /lib   = library files that are common across different software packages we install on the machine are placed here
7. /media = media devices like ipod, music players, camera are mounted here
8. /mnt   = the network drives or network storage devices are mounted in /mnt directory
9. /opt   = all the optional software packages that are installed on the operating system are placed here
10. /root = root user home directory
11. /proc = The information about all the running programs are kept as files within the /proc directory
12. /sbin = super user commands are placed here
13. /tmp  = temporary files are kept here
14. /var  = variable large object files usually the log files of the system are placed here
15. /usr  = utilities and files shared between the users are placed here

Inorder to see the above filesystem directories, upon login to the operating system, open terminal. Then type the below commands.
cd /   = navigate or change directory to "/" (root)
ls -l  = list all files and folders under the current directory in long-listing format

we can see the files and folders under an give directory using tree command. Tree shows all the directories along with their sub directories under the specified directory in a tree like structure visually.
	
by default the tree software package is not available aspart of ubuntu operating system, we need to explicitly install it using the below commands.
	
sudo apt update -y
sudo = is used for executing any linux command under root user previlige or permission, so it prompts for root user password.
	
sudo apt install -y tree = this will install tree command or software package.	

	
using the tree command we can see the directories under the "/"	by using the below command
cd /
tree -L 1
