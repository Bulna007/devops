What is devops?
A change in culture and adoption of new tools and technologies, for fast-paced application development and fast-paced application delivery is called "devops"
	
Why do we need fast-paced application development and delivery?
There are several reasons for an organization to adopt the aspect of "fast-paced development and delivery":
1. To be ahead of the competitors in the market
If an organization is delivering the product slowly than its competitors, then the competitors will overtake the market and becomes leader thus creating a severe loss for the business

2. To increase the ROI for the customer, so that longitivity of the business can be achieved
When the organization delivers more features quite faster to the market, the customer always feels return of investment and continue to stay with the organization, there by which the longitivity of the business is guaranteed.
	
3. To reduce the cost of infrastructure and development in delivering the system
if we can develop and deliver the software quickly we can bring down the overall cost of building/maintaining the software applications, so that everyone can adopt right from (enterprise to small-scale businesses) and can use the software.
