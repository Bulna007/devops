2. How to remove an existing file?
rm filename

rm stands for remove and is used for removing/deleting a file from the Filesystem. 
Note:- once we remove the file using rm, it is an permanent delete, and cannot be restored

3. How to remove multiple files?
For eg..
$HOME
|-favorites
|-wishlist
|-stories

rm favorites
rm wishlist
rm stories

all the linux commands takes multiple arguments as inputs, rather than type 3 times the same rm command we can pass #3 filenames as input at one shot
rm favorites wishlist stories

4. How to forcibily remove a file on the Filesystem?
There are few files that are considered as special files by the linux operating system, so while removing them using rm linux prompts for confirmation (y/n)	to delete the file.
Incase if we wish to delete the file without prompting for confirmation, we can use -f option as below

rm -f filename

5. How to delete a directory?
There are 2 ways we can delete a folder or a directory

#1 approach:
rmdir directoryName

rmdir deletes/removes a directory only when the given directory is empty. if the directory is not empty, we should manually go into the directory and remove all the files and sub-directories inside it before deleting the directory

for eg..
$HOME
|-library
  |-comics
		|-file.txt
	|-adventure
		|-action
			|-file2.txt
		|-war
			|-file3.txt
If we want to delete the directory library, first we need to delete file3.txt, war, file2.txt, action , adventure, file.txt, commics and then finally library
starts with lowest in the hierarchy to the top, this is safe approach of deleting the directory, because we always know what we are deleting

But it is an lengthy process and if we have lot of sub-directories with files, we need to navigate all the way down in the tree and delete and takes more time

Instead we can use approach #2

#2 approach:
rm -r directoryName

here -r stands for recursively delete all the files/folders under the specified directory along with the given directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
command = no revoke, no rollback
