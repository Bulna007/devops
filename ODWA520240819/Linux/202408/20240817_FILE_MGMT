3. How to forcibily delete a file on the Filesystem?

4. How to delete an directory?
There are 2 ways we can delete an directory in Linux operating system
1. rmdir

rmdir directoryName
inorder to delete an directory using rmdir, the directory should be empty, otherwise we need to manually go into the directory and sub-directories and delete all of them before we delete the parent

2. rm -r directory = -r stands for recursively

1. How to move a file from one directory location to a different directory location?
	
mv sourceFile destinationDir	

2. How to move a directory along with its contents from source to the destination location?
mv sourceDir destinationDir

$HOME
|-tourplans
	|-aug
		|-trip1.txt
	|-sep
		|-trip2.txt
	|-oct
		|-trip3.txt
|-archives

move tourplans/aug/ directory to archives/ directory
~/> mv tourplans/aug archives/
	
3. How to move the contents of a directory into another directory?
$HOME
|-tourplans
	|-aug
		|-trip1.txt
	|-sep
		|-action
			|-trip2.txt
		|-adventure
			|-trip3.txt
	|-oct
		|-trip3.txt
|-archives
	
here we dont want to move sep/ directory rather just move the contents of the sep/ directory into archives
mv "tourplans/sep/*" archives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How to rename a file or directory?
In bash, there is no command for renaming a file or directory. But we can logically rename a file or directory by using mv itself

$HOME
|-products
	|-footwear.txt
	|-kitchen-appliances.txt
	|-furniture.txt
	
we want to rename kitchen-appliances.txt to appliances.txt
~/products:/> mv kitchen-appliances.txt appliances.txt
if we dont specify the destination directory and gave another filename, it works as rename

To rename a directory in the mv specify the destination directory as non-existing, so that it consider it as a rename.
mv products globalProducts

All about copy files/folders

cp stands for copy used for copying files/folders from one location to the another location or just to duplicate the files or folders by creating one more copy. By using cp the source/destination files will not be moved (it is not cut/copy). rather it would only copy the existing file into new directory

1. How to copy a file from one location to another location?
$HOME
|-products
	|-popular
		|-mens-fashion.txt
		|-clothing.txt
		|-jewellery.txt
	|-trending
	
let us copy clothing.txt from popular/ directory into trending/ directory using cp command
~/products:/> cp popular/clothing.txt trending/
	
during the time of copy we can specify a different name with which the file should be copied into the destination directory as below

~/products:/>cp popular/mens-fashion.txt trending/mens-apparels.txt
now the mens-fashion.txt file will be copied into trending/ directory with name mens-apparels.txt

2. How to copy a directory along with its contents into another directory?
cp only copy the file from one location to another location. cp by default doesnt works for directories. If we want to copy the directory and its contents into a different location we need to use -R switch (recursively)	
	
$HOME
|-products
	|-popular
		|-mens-fashion.txt
		|-clothing.txt
		|-jewellery.txt
	|-trending

warehouse/
	
we want to copy popular/ directory into warehouse/
~/products:/> cp -R popular/ warehouse/
	
if we want to just copy the contents of the popular directory into warehouse
~/products:/> cp -R popular/* warehouse/
