There are 3 main components of the computer:
1. Monitor        = output device
2. Keyboard/Mouse = input devices
3. Cpu     
	1. processor    = brain of the computer, the perform computation operations like
		1.1 Arthematic operations  (add, substract, multiplication, division, modulus)
		1.2 Relational operations  (greatherThan, lessThan, greaterThanEqual, lessThanEqual, EqualTo, notEqualTo)
		1.3 Logical operations     (and, or , not)
	
2. ram          (random access memory) = it is the primary memory of the computer and it is volatile in nature. The data we stored in the ram will be erased upon restarting the computer.
purpose: all the data that should be used by the processor to perform computation operation will be brought and placed within the RAM, so that the processor can fetch/access the data quickly
	
3. harddisk     = permanent storage memory of the computer. It is an mechanical device and will be very slow in storing/fetching the data. once the data is stored in harddisk, it will be permanent and would survive even the restart of the computer until we explicitly delete the data

4. motherboard  = all the parts of the computer are inter-connected with each other through the help of motherboard of the computer.

Who and how does the computers perform the computation operation?
The processor is the core component that performs the computation operation within the computer. It is an electronic device, an electronic device has only 2 states
1. on  = power on
2. off = power off

these are represented with 1 (on) and 0 (off) respectively. any operation we want to perform should be represented or presented to the processor interms of 1s and 0s only which is called "Machine Language".
	
previously we learnt processor performs arthematic, relational and logical operations, let us say we wanted to add #2 numbers, how can we pass the numbers asking processor to perform the operations?
	
From the above we can understand processor always can understand "Machine language"	only (something that is expressed interms of 1s and 0s)
