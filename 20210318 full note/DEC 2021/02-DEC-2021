What is maven build lifecycle?
Lifecycle comprises of standard phases where each phase is associated with set of plugins/goals which will be executed to perform an build activity.
There are 3 standard maven lifecycles are there
1. default lifecycle
2. site lifecycle
3. clean lifecycle

#1 default lifecycle has 7 phases defined and maven has associated default plugins for each phase to perform build operation automatically	
	1.1 validate
	1.2 compile
	1.3 test
	1.4 package
	1.5 verify
	1.6 install
	1.7 deploy
	
#2 site lifecycle = used for generating java documentation for a project, it has only 1 phase associated with 1 plugin:goal
2.1 site
		|-site (plugin)
			|-site (goal)
#3 clean lifecycle = used for deleting previously generated target/ directory of a project, since always we dont want to clean, it has been added as separate lifecycle. clean lifecycle has 1 clean phase with 1 clean plugin with a goal clean
3.1 clean
		|-clean (plugin)
			|-clean (goal)

when we want to run a maven build specify mvn phase (of a lifecycle) 
mvn phase(l1) phase(l2) phase(l3)
maven takes care of executing all the phases from top to the bottom till we specified by executing each of plugins and their goals in the configured order.
	
Due to the Standardized Lifecycle phases, building any maven project would be same which is as simple as running
mvn clean verify|install|package|compile

without knowing the details of the project anyone can perform building an application "the real power of maven"
