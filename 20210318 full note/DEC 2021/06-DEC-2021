jfrog artifactory oss repository
any artifactory repositories serves for 3 reasons
1. to distribute the build artifacts of an application locally between the teams within the organization
2. to help us in distributing the dependencies across the various stages of ci/cd implementation
3. proxying the remote repositories like mavencentral, jcentral and bitnary repositories

How many stages in which an artifact can be there?
There are 4 stages in which an artifact can be there and we use namespace suffix to identify the stage in which artifact is there
1. snapshot = the artifact has been produced from developer machine
2. alpha/beta = under the stages of testing and has passed (preliminary testing)
3. rc = release candidate, qa certification has been finished and scheduled for release
4. release = publicly available

How do we distribute the above artifacts to the world using repositories?
In general we create 2 types of repositories
1. snapshot repositories = snapshot repositories are used for distributing the artifacts under snapshot, alpha/beta, rc
2. release repositories = artifacts released to public (release)
	
How to install and use JFrog artifactory oss?
-----------------------------------------------
JFrog artifactory oss repository works only on domain name, it doesnt allows ip:port based urls in serving the artifacts. So to work with jfrog and make it accessible over domain name only we need apache2 server which plays a role of proxy here.
	
#1. Install and Configure apache2 server
1. sudo apt update -y
2. sudo apt install -y apache2

3. we need to enable proxy modules in apache2 server to forward request to jfrog artifactory
 - sudo a2enmod proxy
 - sudo a2enmod proxy_http
 #- sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
 #- sudo a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests
