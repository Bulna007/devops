Elastic Load balancer
---------------------
Elastic load balancer is used for distributing the traffic source across multiple target group of instances
The aws cloud platform supports 3 types of loadbalancers
1. application load balancer
http protocol based load balancer which means it works for only http/https based protocol requests only. It supports routing the requests based on
	1. url
	2. query expressions
	3. headers
etc
so it is specially design to work with web application in distributing network traffic.

2. network load balancer
Network load balancer works for any other protocol irrespectively. unlike application load balancer here we cannot configure path-based or header based routing
here we can configure a listener to listen for the request on a specific protocol and port and forward/distribute the request to target group of servers

3. gateway load balancer
it is used for gatewaying the request through the appliances like firewall or a traffic inspector or a monitoring tool etc before the data packets are delivered to the destination
