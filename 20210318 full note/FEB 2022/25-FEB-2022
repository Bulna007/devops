1. How does terraform provisions infrastructure resources across the cloud providers?
Each cloud provider offers different resources/services and they expose cloudsdks and apis in provisioning the infrastructure resources

To support working with multiple cloud providers and their various different apis or sdks terraform has introduced plugin-based architecture

For each provider we have a provider plugin that takes care of communicating with the relevant cloud provider sdk/api in provisioning the infrastructure, so that terraform supports multiple cloud providers by simply swapping provider plugin

2. Does Terraform configuration we write works across various cloud providers in provisioning the infrastructure resources?
different cloud provider platforms has different resources/services so a terraform configuration file written for provisioning resources of a cloud provider will not work for other providers since those resources are not available with others.

3. What are the components of the Terraform?
There are total 4 components are there
1. Terraform CLI
2. Terraform Configuration
3. Provider Plugin
4. Cloud Provider Api

4. what are the advantages of terraforms?
1. hybrid iac provider that works for any of the cloud provider platforms
2. standardized workflow automation in provisioning the infrastructure across any platforms
