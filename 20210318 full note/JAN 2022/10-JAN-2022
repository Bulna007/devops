File Category 
The other important module categories in ansible is File Category where we can find bunch of modules related to file operations like 
- creating files/folders
- modifying the ownership and permissions
- copying
- inline edit
even though the above operations can be performed through shell/command module it is not recommended to use them rather use File category modules only for idempotancy

Let us explore modules of the File category
#1. copy module
copy module is used for copying the files/folders from ansible control node to the managed nodes of the fleet
by default it looks for the source file we specified on the FileSytem location of ansible control node and copies to the destination directory of the Managed Node, incase if we have the source file also located on Managed Node itself locally then we can specify remote_src: true indicating the source is also available on the managed node itself.
	
copy module configuration options or arguments
1. copy a file from source to the destination
copy:
  src:
  dest:

2. copy a file from source to destination under a specified owner/group with permission
copy:
  src:
  dest:
	owner: 'owner'
	group: 'group'
	mode: '0777'
		
3. validate file before copying to destination
copy:
  src: 
  dest:
  validate: "/usr/bin/visudo -csf %s"

the other options available are:
backup: yes/no

#2. File module
File module is used for creating a new file/folder or changing the permissions of an existing file/folder or removing them

#1. create a new file
file:
  path:
  state: touch
	
#2. create a directory
file:
  path:
  state: directory
	
#3. how to create a symlink file to an existing file
~/a.txt
ln -s ~/Desktop/a.txt ~/a.txt

file:
  src:
  dest:
  owner:
  group:
  state: link | hard
	
note: softlink owner and group is not applicable, only for hardlinks we need owner/group

#4. how to change owner and group and file permissions for an existing file
existing file = ~/a.txt
sudo chown bob:bob ~/a.txt
sudo chmod 755 ~/a.txt
file:
  path: ~/a.txt
	group:
	owner:
  mode:  

#5.
For a file/folder in linux, the linux operating system will not keeps track of the created timestamp, it has 2 timestamps for a file/directory which are
1. accessed time = when we read/copy/move a file accessed time will be changed
2. modified time = if we change the contents inside file
3. change time = when we modify the attributes of the file like owner/group, filename, permissions etc

How to preserve of modify the modification_time and access_time of a file?
file: 
  path:
  mode: 0755
	modification_time: preserve
	access_time: preserve
	
the possible values for access_time and modification_time is: now or preserve	or set to custom date and time format  '{{ "%Y%m%d%H%M.%S" | strftime(stat_var.stat.atime) }}'
