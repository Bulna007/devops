What is YAML?
YAML stands for Yet another markup language which is a data representation standard language used for storing, writing and representing the data similar to Xml and Json.
	
What are the datatypes supported by YAML?
YAML supports 3 different datatypes
1. string = by default any text of information we write in yaml is treated as String, and we dont have to sourround them in double quotes even they have spaces
2. number = any sequence of digits we write is considered as numbers
3. boolean = true, false, yes, no all are permitted values for a boolean

YAML supports 2 types of data structures
1. LIST
2. MAP

#1. LIST
List in YAML is also called as sequences and a list of values are represented through - (dash) and has to be intended at the same level to be considered as one list

products.yaml
- television
- refregirator
- washing machine
- mobile

#2. MAP
MAP in YAML is also called as "dictionaries" or "associated arrays" which are nothing but key/value pairs of data representing an object or an entity. The key or the value dont need to be sourrounded with double quotes and should be separated by ":" colon and space

product.yaml
-----------------
productNo: 9398
productName: led 32 inch samsung tv
description: 32 inch full hd smart samsung television
price: 32000
	
	
An YAML file should start with --- and end with ... indicating the begin of the YAML document and end of the YAML document, we can write multiple YAML documents in a single YAML file by using "---" and "..."
YAML files can be stored with either an extension of ".yml"	or ".yaml"

Playbook
playbooks in ansible are written in yaml format in which ansible developers declare ansible modules to achieve the desired system state of the ansible fleet servers

#1. every playbook can contain multiple plays as part of it, representing different automations we want to apply on different group of machines.
For eg we can define a play in a playbook to install jdk software package on javaserver group and another play to install db2 database on dbserver group machines.				
We dont have to really write 2 different playbooks to achieve this				



ping.yml
---
- name: play1
  hosts: group1
	tasks:
    - name: taskName
		  module:
       arg: value
			 arg: value
- name: play2
  hosts: group2
	tasks:
   - name: taskName
	   module:
      arg: value
			arg: value
...
