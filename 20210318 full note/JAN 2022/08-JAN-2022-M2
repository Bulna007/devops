2. A play defines the follow
	1. name = describing what we achieve by applying the play
	2. hosts = group of servers on whom we want to apply the play (list)
	3. tasks = list of tasks we want to apply on the group of servers
3. each task is wrapped with an module declaration in it.
A module is a unit of work we want to perform on a fleet server, using a module we can accomplish various different types of tasks, so by wrapping a module into a task declaration we can derive what is the module is used for accomplishing that is where each module has to be declared within a task
