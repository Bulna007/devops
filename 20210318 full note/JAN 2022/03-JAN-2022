How to install ansible on windows 10?
In windows 10 Windows Subsystem Linux2 is a feature through which we can run Ubuntu on windows 10 operating system on the Hyper-V hypervisor.
	
So that we can install Ansible control node on WSL2 and we can create Ansible Managed Nodes on oracle virtualbox so that we can have ansible cluster running.
	
1. How to install WSL2?
1.1 open powershell in windows under administrator rights
1.2 wsl --install
1.3 verify wsl2 ubuntu is running on your machine by typing the below command
	wsl -l -v
1.4 to turn off the wsl2 ubuntu machine	
wsl --shutdown
1.5 to poweron WSL2 machine
wsl

2. configure WSL2 networking for public access.	
by default WSL2 creates an virtual either network adapter with nat network as a network mode only enabling one-directional traffic. To enable public access to the WSL2 machine we need to enable port forwarding from the host machine.
	
but in the latest version of WSL2 the network traffic is working on bi-directional mode if we enable windows defender firewall, so the above port forwarding is not required.
	
How to enable firewall access to access WSL2 machine from public network?	
1. goto windows defender
2. click on allow an app or feature through windows defender firewall
	choose file and printer sharing and check the boxes to allow access
the above step enables ping access
3. click on advanced settings
4. create both inbound/outbound rules
	1. choose port based rule and enter port 22
	2. allow connections
	3. enter rule name click finish
This will enable bi-directional traffic to WSL2 machine

3. Provision Managed Nodes on Virtualbox
	1. create 2 virtual machines
	2. choose the networking mode as bridge network on (wifi adapter)
	3. choose static ip address
take the help of vagrant in provisioning the above virtual machines	
make sure we are able to reach through ping on all the machines of the cluster.
WSL2->Host Host->WSL2
WSL2->Guests Guests->WSL2

4. create a new user on all the managed nodes with the same user of WSL2
5. configure passwordless suoders access to the new user created on managed nodes
6. generate SSH Key pair on WSL2 machine and copy the public key on both the managed servers
7. verify the SSH connection from WSL2 machine to both managed servers
if we are able to SSH the networking has been configured properly

How to install Ansible on WSL2?
	
1. goto WSL2 machine
2. sudo apt update -y
