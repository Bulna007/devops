There are 3 way we can pass the configmap as an input to the pod
1. environment variables/command-line arguments
2. we can configmap with configuration files as volume mounts in podspec
3. we can access the configmap using api in the applications

2. How to pass the configmap with configuration files as volumes in podspec?

roadster-configmap.yml
-----------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
	name: roadsterplacesconfigmap
data:
	places.properties |
		Hyderabad=Madhapur
		Chennai=Mahabalipuram
		Banglore=MG Road
		Delhi=Caunat Place
		Pune=Wakad

roadster-pod.yml
----------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: roadsterpod
	labels:
		app: roadster
spec:
	containers:
		- name: roadster
			image: techsriman/roadster:2.0
			ports:
				- name: http
					containerPort: 8082
					protocol: TCP
			volumeMounts:
				- name: roadstervolume
					mountPath: /config
					readonly: true
	volumes:
		- name: roadstervolume
			configMap:
				name: roadsterplacesconfigmap
				items:
					- key: places.properties
						path: "places.properties"

we defined a volume with name roadstervolume that contains configMap properties. now we are mounting this volume into the container under the path /config
