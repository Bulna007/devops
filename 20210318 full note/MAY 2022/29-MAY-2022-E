Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim
----------------------------------------------
Persistence volumes is a storage that is defined on a kubernetes cluster and the it is created by the kubernetes administrator

Persistent volume claim = is a request for that storage to be consumed by the devops engineer that can be consumed as part of the pod

There are few attributes we can attach to the persistent volume:
1. storageClassName
it talks about the type of storage we wanted to create on the cluster
2. accessMode:
ReadOnly = only pods can read the data from this volume
ReadWriteOnce = only one pod/user can write/read at one time
ReadWriteMultiple = multiple pod/user can read/write at the same time

3. capacity:
size of the storage volume
