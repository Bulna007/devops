What are labels and annotations in kubernetes?
Labels are the key/value pairs we can attach to any kubernetes object we create on the cluster.	These acts as an identifiers in querying and accessing the objects back from the kubernetes.
	
We create a Service or DaemonSet or ReplicaSet on a Pod by using Label as an Selector to identify the pods on the cluster

We can attach labels to the pod in 2 ways
1. we can define labels inside the object spec/manifest
2. we can add labels to a object during runtime

#1. define labels in a pod spec
pod.yml
-------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: sailorpod
	labels:
		version: 1.0
		app: sailor
spec:
	containers:
		- name: sailor
			image: techsriman/sailorrepo:2.0
			ports:
				- name: http
					containerPort: 8080
					protocol: TCP

1. How to see the pods along with the labels attached
kubectl get pods --show-labels

2. How to query the pod of a specific label
kubectl get pods -l labelKey=labelValue

3. How to attach label to an running pod?
kubectl label pods podName key=value

What are annotations?
annotations are arbitary key-value pair we can attach to any kubernetes object. unlike labels we cannot select/query the objects based on annotations, these doesnt acts as identifiers of the	object
Those are just meant for attaching documentation to the kubernetes object

we can define annotations as part of the object spec as below:
pod.yml
-------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: sailorpod
	annotations:
		author: patrik
		license: GPL
spec:
	containers:
		- name: sailor
			image: techsriman/sailorrepo:2.0
			ports:
				- name: http
					containerPort: 8080
					protocol: TCP

What are ConfigMaps and why do we need to use in Kubernetes?
