1. What is containerization technology?
containerization technology is used for running an software application isolated from others on a machine/computer

purpose/advantage :-
	1.1 containers are light weight and consumes very less amount of system resources in running an application (as the operating system will not be running within the container)
	1.2 the software application delivery process can be abstracted, so that without knowing the underlying technology people can run the software
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
When to use 
containerization?:
Containerization has to be used when we want to run multiple s/w applications on the same computer/machine isolated from each other

virtualization?:
If we want to provide 2 independent dedicated environments for different people for their usage, then we need to use virtualization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the features of the linux operation system required for running containerization?
1. Linux namespaces
2. cgroups
3. union filesystem
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker architecture
There are 3 components are their in docker
1. docker engine
	1.1 docker daemon = api/http endpoints to allow users/clients to communicate with docker engine
	1.2 containerd = pull the image from registry, convert into oci image format and pass to runc
	1.3 runc = container runtime that creates the oci containers by talking to the underlying operating system
	
2. docker cli = tool for communicating with docker engine
3. docker container registry = publishing and distributing the docker images
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are docker objects?
There are 2 docker objects are there
1. docker image
an application packaged with software libraries, instructions in running the software application along with libs & bins required for communicating with docker engine put together is called an docker image
characteristics:-
	1. layered and stackable
	2. read-only
	
2. docker container
program or a process that is created out of an docker image which is under execution is called an "container".
