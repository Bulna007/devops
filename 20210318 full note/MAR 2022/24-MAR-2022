How does docker containers are isolated from each other while running on the same operating system?
There are 3 major features of linux operating system are there while enables isolating a container from another
#1. linux namespaces
namespaces helps in isolating a container from another container running on the same machine. each docker container runs out of its own namespace and can access the resources that are allocated to that namespace only.
Below are the namespaces supported by linux to keep containers isolated
1. pid
2. net
3. uts
4. mts
5. ipc

#2. Control Groups (cgroups)
helps in sharing the resources of the machine and limiting their usage across the containers

#3. Union Filesystem
docker images are packaged based on union filesystem to keep them light weight
