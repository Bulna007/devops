How to install docker on ubuntu machine?
There are 2 versions of the docker
1. docker community edition
2. docker enterprise edition
we have to install community edition only which is opensource

#1. open terminal on ubuntu
#2. sudo apt update -y
#3. There are few mandatory dependent packages that has to be installed before installing the docker on the machine
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

#4. 
docker is not available as part of ubuntu official repository, so we need to add docker repository to the source.list

#5. we need to download and add gpg key of the repository 
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

#6. add docker repository to our sources.list
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"

#7. sudo apt update -y
#8. sudo apt install docker-ce

The above installation process creates an user: docker and group: docker and installs the docker software and configures it as system service under the user docker only

Now our linux user cannot access the docker engine since he dont has access permissions, so we need to add the current linux user to docker group by running the below command

#9. sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
#10. sudo init 6
