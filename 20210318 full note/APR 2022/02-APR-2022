#1. How to run a docker container as a daemon?
There are software applications that are deployed on servers/platforms/infra/runtimes and executes for longer time, until we terminate. If we launch such packaged applications as docker containers normally/interactively, the keep hold of the terminal (TTY) and will be executed. If we close the terminal the containers will be terminated automatically

So to ensure they dont block TTY and dont get terminated upon closing the terminal we need to launch such process non-interactively as daemons 

docker container run -d image:tag 
docker container run -d tomcat:9.0
	
#2. How to run a docker container with a given name?
docker container --name containerName image:tag
docker container -d --name tomcatserver tomcat:9.0
	
#3. How to launch a container that gets removed automatically upon termination?
docker container run -d --name containerName --rm image:tag
here rm indicates remove the container upon termination automatically

#4. How to see the logs generated by the program running inside the container?
docker container logs id/name
docker container logs -f id/name = f stands for flow, means scroll through the generating logs of the container application

#5. How to enter into a daemon container that is running and grab the TTY or execute a command?
when we launch the container non-interactively the TTY (terminal) is not attached to the container and we cannot access/go inside the container

docker container exec -it id/name command

docker container run -d --name tomcatserver tomcat:9.0
docker container exec -it tomcatserver bash

#6. There is another way we can enter into running container as below.
docker container attach id/name = will attaches the terminal to the container making it interactive. so if we exit from the terminal the container will be terminated

#7. How to see the details of a container?
docker container inspect id/name
displays the entire information about the container like
cpu, memory, storage, id, image_id, network interface cards, ip addresses, port nos exposed etc
