9. How to push our own docker image into the docker container registry?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. login into the docker hub registry "http://hub.docker.com"
2. navigate into the repositories menu from top and choose create repository inside it.
3. provide a name for the repository in which we want to store an docker image.
In one repository we store one docker image attaching with tags indicating multiple versions. Here the repository name is nothing but your docker image name
4. goto your docker daemon or workstation and login into your docker hub registry using
docker login (prompt for dockerid/password)
	
5. rename your local cached docker image into repository format as 
dockerid/repositoryname:tag
dockerid = helps to identify the account into which the image has to be pushed
repositoryname = nothing but image name identifies into which repository of the user this image should be pushed
tag = version of the image

6. docker image push dockerid/repositoryname:tag
