VOLUME directive
----------------
A containerized application during its execute might generate the data, by default it is written on container writable layer of that container. There are few drawbacks of writing the data to the container writable layer
	1. writing the data to container writable layer results in poor i/o operation and results in performance issue
	2. up on container crash or destroyed the data generated by the application into container writable layer is lost
	
From the above we can understand all the data written/produced by the applications are small/temporary data which will lost upon destroying the container by which we can understand docker has designed the containers to be stateless

There are 2 reasons to design docker containers as stateless:
	1. the containerized applications can be quickly scalable
	2. containers are quickly recoverable
	
Not all the applications are stateless, there are applications that generates the data out of their execution, for eg, we can package a database server inside the image and run inside a container, it generates the data (.data files) and stores on container writable layer.
if the database server container has been crashed,the entire data stored inside database is lost, to help in managing or storing the data of a statefull applications docker has introduced 2 ways of storing the data externalized to the container
	1. bind mounts
	2. docker volumes
	
If your containerized application is producing the data that has to persisted then such containers are called "stateful" containers and to manage their state we need to use bind mounts or docker volumes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1. bind mounts
----------------
Bind Mounts are the directories of the host machine are mounted to the directory locations of the container. So that all the data produced by the containerized application into that directory location will be stored on host filesystem directory

So incase of container crash we can quickly spin one more contaier by mounting the same bind mount onto the new container, so that data will not be lost

advantages:-
	1. Both the containerized application and host can see/use the data since it is stored on the host machine and mounted on the container
	
dis-advantages:-
	1. bind mounts works based on host filesystem, if the host platform is not compatible with the container platform, then there is a chance of running into data incompatibility issues in storing the data
	2. bind mounts are slow in read/writing the data when compared with docker volumes
	3. the docker engineer/devops engineer is responsible for manually managing the bind mounts like
		1. create
		2. backup
		3. recovery/migrating
		
		
How to work with bind mounts?
#1 on the host computer/docker workstation create a directory location where you want the containerized application data should be stored
#2 provide necessary permissions to the directory

There are 2 syntaxes in mounting the host directory onto the container at the time of launching the container
#1. -v or --volume (old) (less readable)
syntax:
-v sourcedir:targetdir:propagrationsettings
The propagration settings are optional and can take any of the 3 below values
	1.1 ro = readonly 
	1.2 z = the bind mount becomes sharable and can be reused across multiple containers
	1.3 Z = the bind mount and its content is private to the container and cannot be reused across the containers
	
		
docker container run -v sourcedirectory:targetdirectory:propagration image:tag
docker container run -it -v /u01/data:/u01/data:Z ubuntu:20.04 bin/bash
bash# touch /u01/data/message.txt
bash# echo "Good Morning!" > /u01/data/message.txt
bash# exit
docker container rm c1

#2. --mount (new style)
syntax:- key/value pair, and is more abbrevative form of mouting the bind mounts
--mount type=bind,source=sourcedir,target=targetdir,propagationSettings

propagationSettings can have below values:
1. readonly
2. shared
3. private
docker container run --mount type=bind,source=/u01/data,target=/u01/data,shared -it ubuntu:20.04 bin/bash
