Helm charts
------------
Kubernetes is an container cluster manager, that takes care of scheduling, monitoring and managing the containerized applications on a network cluster. To work with kubernetes in deploying and managing the applications we need to create various different types of kubernetes objects like
	- pods
	- replicaset
	- deploymentset
	- service
	- job
	etc

In addition to the above an application may have other external dependent componets like an database server or a third-party application software required to be available before running the application.
These dependent components should be containerized and have to create the relevant manifests for deploying them on the kubernetes cluster.
	
So to run an application on kubernetes cluster we need to 
1. identify the dependent components/external application libraries and need to create their objects to make them run on the cluster
2. there after we need to create our application objects on the cluster.
	
running the application on a k8s cluster seems to be quite complex job since one has to know the knowledge of dependent components and each of the resources/k8s objects has to be created manually in a specific order. In addition these objects should be deployed across multiple env in an organization which is an time consuming job and might lead to errors.
	
To overcome the above problem, helm charts are introduced.
Helm is a package manager for kubernetes applications. Helm has been awarded as an official package manager for the kubernetes by Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
	
Helm can be treated similar to any other package managers that we typically encounter various different domains. For eg we can consider helm as
	- maven tool = in java
	- pip = python
	- apt - ubuntu operating system 
	etc
	
there are build/package managment tools, that takes care of identifying the dependencies, downloading them from repositories, build the applications using the dependencies and packages them and makes them readily deployable.
