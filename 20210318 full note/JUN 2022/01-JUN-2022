Deployment
------------
Deployment is another way of deploying containerized application on the kubernetes cluster. Through deployment controller any changes to the pod template can be rolledout in a controlled way.
	
To expose the pod/service/deployment over the cluster we can use port-forwarded on kubernetes.
kubectl port-forward pod/podName sourcePort:targetPort
kubectl port-forward deployment/deployment sourceport:targetport
