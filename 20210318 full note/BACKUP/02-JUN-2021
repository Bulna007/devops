What is Devops?
Faster application development and delivery.

Why do we need faster application development and delivery?
  - to bring down the cost of building software application
  - to be ahead of competitors
  - to provide ROI for customers
  
How can we achieve faster application development and delivery through devops, what does devops provides to accomplish it?
It has suggested 2 things
  1. change the culture in which people are working
  2. adopt devops tools and technologies in building applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of the devops tools works on Linux platform only. So to start with devops we need good knowledge on Linux operating system.

What is Linux?
Linux is an Multi-User, Multi-process operating system.

What is an Operating System, why do we use it?

For a user to use a computer he has to pass instructions to the cpu of the computer, since he is the one who performs the operations.
cpu is an eletronic device, which can only understand the inputs as on/off in terms of computer language an on = 1 & off = 0. this is called machine language/binary language.

conclusion:-
For users to use a computer machine they need to pass instructions in binary language
problem:-
it is hard and difficult for a human to memorize and write instructions in machine language or binary language, thus making computers no use.

How to solve above problem and make computers easy to be used by humans?
We need natural language capabilities through which humans should interact with computer. So help us the hardware manufacturing vendors has introduced assembly-level language.

Assembly Language:-
In assembly language we have pre-defined instruction set represent in human understandable format as 
ADD 
SUB 
MUL 
DIV 
MOD
Now people who want to use computer can write instructions in human language using assembly level instructions and it to cpu, so that it perform operation.
