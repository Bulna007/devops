What is Devops?
Usually the time required for developing software applications are very high in industry. 
  
For eg.. a typical application to be developed and delivered to the customer at an average of 6 months - 1 year it will takes.
Looks like the time required for developing and delivery a software applications is taking lot of time due to which many problems will creep up.
  - due to long duration of developer/delivery the manufacturing cost of the software is huge.
  - we are out of market competition
  - customer loose Return of Investment.

From the above we can understand we want to build faster applications and delivery quickly to the market otherwise a company will be out of the race/game.
  
That is where devops comes into picture

devops helps in achieving fast paced application developed and quick delivery, if the organization is adopting devops.
  
How does devops helps us in building and delivering applications quickly?
  - change the way people are working in the company
    3 - teams | 1 project
    developers "(develop)"               |
    qa         "(test)"                  | -- 1 single team together then efficiency of work will improve
    production engineers "(deliver)"     |      (devops team)
    
- adopt new tools and technologies
  shellscripting  terraform         jenkins     git
  ansible         cloud platform    maven       sonarcube
  puppet          docker            junit       nagios
  chef            kubernetes        vagrant     jfrog artifactory/repository
