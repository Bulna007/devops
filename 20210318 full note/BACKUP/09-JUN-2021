What is the Shell?
Shell is an interpreter program, the help us in communicating with the kernal of the linux operating system. programming to the kernal is very complex and requires low-level programming skills that makes the user difficult to work with linux

So, to overcome the above problem, different people has written shell interpretor program through which we can talk to the kernal more easily.

There are 2 popular shells are available
bourne shell
c shell
each of these shells has sub-types
bourne shell
  1. bourne shell
  2. korn shell
  3. bourne again shell (bash)
  4. POSIX
c shell
  1. c shell
  2. TOPS
  
bourne shell (sh) is older and an improved version is bourne again shell (bash)
  
Working with Files and Folders in Linux
---------------------------------------
#1 how to create a File in linux?
we can create an empty file within linux filesystem using 
touch filename

#2 how to print a message on to the terminal window?
echo "message"

#3 how to see the files/folders that are there in linux machine
ls = displays all the files/folders that are there within the current working directory
ls -l = long listing of files/directories
ls -a = displays hidden files 
hidden file = in linux if we create a file/folder starting with (.) dot, then it is considered as hidden and by default will not be displayed when use ls or ls -l. to display hidden files we need to use -a indicates all 

ls directory/ = displays the files and folders in the given directory

#4 how to create a directory?
  mkdir directoryName
  mkdir -p parent/childdirectory = it creates both parent and child directory together
  
#5 how to write the data into an file?
touch filename = creates as an empty file

echo "Good Morning" > filename = ">" is called redirection operator which will redirect the output into a file given

#6 how to see the contents of a file?
cat filename

#7 how to enter data into a file interactively?
echo "Good Morning" > filename

cat by default takes the data from the keyboard (STDIN) and writes the data onto Console (STDOUT)
cat < filename =  take the input from file and prints onto console

cat > filename

#8 how to change from one directory to another.
  
cd directoryName
cd .. = moves you to parent directory

cd = takes to the user home
cd ~ = takes to the home directory

cd - = takes to the previous directory


#9 how to know the current directory we are in?
pwd = print working directory

#10 how to remove a file on filesystem?
rm filename

#11 how to remove a directory on filesystem?
rmdir directoryName = given the directory should be empty
rm -r = will removes the files/folders inside the directory recursively
rm -rf  = force to remove the files.
  
#12 how to copy a file/folder from one location to another.
cp sourcefile destinationfile
by default cp doesnt support copying folders, only we can copy files. if we want to copy directorys as well then use -r (recursively)
cp -r sourceDirectory destinationDirectory

#13 how to move files and folders within linux 
mv command is used for 2 purposes
1. moving the contents
2. rename


mv sourceFile destinationDirectory/ = move the file to a directory(exists)
mv -r sourceDirectory destinationDirectory/ = -r recursively moves the directory(exists) contents

mv sourceFile newFileName = rename
mv sourceDirectory newDirectoryName = rename
