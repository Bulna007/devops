Linux is defined by its "Kernal". Kernal help us in interacting with the underlying hardware of the computer.

GNU Project Linux = where the open source software contributed, started producing software libraries/utilities for Linux operating system, that can be installed on Linux Kernal to make the Linux more developer/user friendly
  1. desktop
  2. essential utility programs like text editors, browsers, media players etc
  3. File Explorer
  4. Network interfaces
  
How does a user has to use linux operating system?
Install kernal ontop of it install utilities to make it easy to use, but to do this process it is complex job and should be a program to install and configure. To overcome this problem different people/organizations started build packaged linux operating system which comes with everthing called distro.

There are 4 major linux distributions are available
1. Arch
2. Debain
3. Redhat
4. Slackware

There are 2 popular linux distros are available.
each of them has provided flavours of linux
1. debain 
  1.1 linux mint
  1.2 ubuntu
  1.3 elementary os
  1.4 kali linux
  
2. Redhat
  2.1 CentOS
  2.2 Fedora
  2.3 Redhat Enterprise Linux (commercial)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Across these distributions the underlying kernal is same. only the software utilities that are packaged on top of the kernal and distribtued will be different.

What are the Features of Linux operating system.
1. Portable = portable to be installed and used on various different types of hardware platforms.
2. OpenSource = Free distributed and free modifiable
3. Multi-User/Multi Programming = Multiple users can user the linux machine at the same time and can share underlying hardware resources of the computer like cpu, ram, memory etc.
4. Hierarchial Filesystem
5. Shell = A software utility or an interpreter program through which we can communicate with kernal of the computer.
6. Security = authentication, and file based permissions

Linux Architecture
1. Hardware = to the bottom of a computer
2. kernal = to communicate with the hardware of the computer
3. shell = interpreter program to allow us to talk to kernal
4. software utilities build on top of kernal = grep, vi, nano, ls, cat etc

Linux FileSystem
----------------
Filesystem is a technic through which we can store and organize the data on the harddisk of the computer.
The basic building blocks of storing the data on the harddisk of the computer is

1. File = DataStructure in which we keep hold of the memory locations of the harddisk where the actual data is resided.

2. Folder = A special type of File in which we store the pointers to the other Files/Folders of the computer. It helps us in group related information so that we can navigate and access easily.

Every operating system has their own Filesystem technic of storing and organizing the data on a harddisk.
Windows:- FAT = File Allocation Table
          NTFS = New Technology File System
          
Linux:- ext4 = extension 4 (default filesystem)
few of the old filesystem technics linux use to support:-
Ext
Ext2
Ext3
JFS
XFS
BTRFS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fileystem Hierarchy in Linux
By default when we install linux operating system on our computer, it will gets installed on to harddisk of the computer by creating standard directory layout.

standard directory structure
/
|-mnt
|-opt
|-etc
|-tmp
|-var
|-proc
|-bin
|-sbin
|-media
|-home
|-dev
|-lib
|-root
|-usr
|-boot
